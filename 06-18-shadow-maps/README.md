In order to view it in the browser, you'll have to serve the root directory of this repository, so the "glance" directory is visible from the served location.
I suggest using Python for it, with

    python3 -m http.server

All of the code is included in the index.html file.
Feel free to play around with the constants and see how things change. You will need to reload the page after every change.
