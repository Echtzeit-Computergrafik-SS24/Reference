This is all of the WebGL code that was presented during the lecture.
You can use this for reference and to help you getting started with setting up your own 3D scene.

They are meant to be run in the classroom environment, but you can run most am them anywhere, by pasting the code into the `boilerplate.md` file and opening it in the browser.
For anything involving glance, you will need to run a small webserver. Same goes for any other code that loads additional resources.

If image links are missing (if they are pointing to something like `/img/texture`) you need to re-point them to `https://echtzeit-computergrafik-ss24.github.io/img/` instead.

For an example scene using the glance library, have alook at `05-14-vao/exercise-end.js`, the threeway comparison between webgl / threejs and glance in `05-17-engine` and of course the example in `glance/index.html`.
